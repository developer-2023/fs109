    <div>
        This div element has initial height of defined size...
    </div>
    <div>
        ... but it adapts (if necessary) its height according to the current content size thanks to min-height property.
    </div>
    <div>
        On the other hand thanks to max-height property it can protect against growing too much by setting its maximum height. That's why you can't see this paragraph in its entirety. Although I can assure you that there is nothing interesting there anymore.
